# leaflet-mapping
Map of earthquakes and tectonic plates

## Getting Started

This codebase is for a map that displayes the past 7 days of earthquake date (based on retrieval url) as circles, with color indicating depth as shown in the legend and the width shows the magnatude. Tectonic plate boundries are displayed in orange. These markers can be turned on or off using the control in the top right of the page. The user can also toggle between 3 map themes: satalite, grayscale, and outdoors.

To get started, download the folder structure. An API key is required in a seperate congig.py file (not included). You can get an API by [signing up for mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/ "signing up for mapbox")

This project uses html, css, javascript, mapbox and leaflet
